# Security

This project follows RFC-002 (Security Hardening) and takes a defense-in-depth approach.

Reporting
- If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please open an issue with the `security` label or email security@example.com with a clear proof-of-concept and steps to reproduce. Do NOT include sensitive data in the issue body.

Policy
- We triage all reports within 48 hours. Critical issues are patched immediately with out-of-band communication where necessary.

Dependency scanning
- We run automated dependency scans in CI and require fixes for high/critical vulnerabilities.

Maintainers
- Security maintainers: see MAINTAINERS.md

Acknowledgements
- Thank you to contributors and security researchers who responsibly disclose issues.
